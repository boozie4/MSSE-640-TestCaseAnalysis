# SECTION 1: Introduction

Equivalence Class Partitioning is a method of software testing that divides the input or output domain into separate classes of data. These separate classes of data are known as equivalence classes. The input conditions are typically included in the specifications listed for the software being tested. The tester separates the input conditions into different subsets, which are the equivalence classes. Using these equivalence classes, test cases are developed. When setting the equivalence classes, the tester should use both valid and invalid classes in order to ensure productive testing results. The invalid classes are used to represent unexpected input. Often, selecting the equivalence classes is done in a trial-by-error processes. When looking at the same sets of conditions, different testers will often select different classes. 

# SECTION 2: Table/Diagram

Below is a table which represents possible equivalence classes for the Triagle Checker program that was written for class:

| EC1 |             The input variable is a positive integer, valid              |
| EC2 |          The input variable is not a positive integer, invalid           |
| EC3 |      The value of side a plus side b is greater than side c, valid       |
| EC4 | The value of side a plus side b is less than or equal to side c, invalid |
